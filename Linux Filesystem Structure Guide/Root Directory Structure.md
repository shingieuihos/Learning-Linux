# Root Directory Structure
The Linux filesystem follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) which defines the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like operating systems.

# Core System Directories
## /bin - Essential User Binaries
### Purpose: 
Contains essential command binaries that need to be available in single-user mode
### Contents: 
Basic commands like ls, cp, mv, cat, bash, sh
### Access: 
Available to all users
### Critical: 
Required for system boot and basic functionality

## /boot - Boot Loader Files
### Purpose: 
Contains static files required by the boot loader
### Contents: 
Linux kernel, initial RAM disk image (initrd), bootloader configuration
### Files: 
vmlinuz (kernel), initrd.img, grub directory
### Critical: 
Essential for system startup

## /dev - Device Files
### Purpose: 
Contains device files that represent hardware components
### Contents: 
Block devices, character devices, pseudo-devices
### Examples: 
/dev/sda (hard drive), /dev/tty (terminals), /dev/null
### Dynamic: 
Managed by udev in modern systems

## /etc - Configuration Files

### Purpose: 
Host-specific system configuration files
### Contents: 
System-wide configuration files and shell scripts
### Examples: 
/etc/passwd, /etc/hosts, /etc/fstab
### Scope: 
System-wide settings (not user-specific)

## /home - User Home Directories

### Purpose: 
Contains user home directories
### Structure: 
/home/username/ for each user
### Contents: 
User personal files, configurations, documents
### Permissions: 
Each user owns their home directory

## /lib - Essential Shared Libraries

### Purpose: 
Contains library files needed by binaries in /bin and /sbin
### Contents: 
Shared library files (.so), kernel modules
### Critical: 
Required for system binaries to function
### Architecture: 
May have variants like /lib64 for 64-bit systems

## /media - Removable Media Mount Points

### Purpose: 
Mount points for removable media devices
### Usage: 
Automatically mounted USB drives, CDs, DVDs
### Modern: 
Used by desktop environments for auto-mounting
### Temporary: 
Contents change as devices are connected/disconnected

## /mnt - Temporary Mount Points

### Purpose: 
Temporary mount point for filesystems
### Usage: 
Manual mounting of filesystems by system administrators
### Distinction: 
Unlike /media, used for temporary manual mounts
### Examples: 
Mounting network drives, additional hard drives

## /opt - Optional Software Packages

### Purpose: 
Optional application software packages
### Structure: 
Usually organized as /opt/package-name/
### Usage: 
Third-party software, proprietary applications
### Examples: 
Commercial software, large application suites

## /proc - Process Information Pseudo-filesystem

### Purpose: 
Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information
### Contents: 
Running process information, system statistics
### Dynamic: 
Contents generated by kernel in real-time
### Examples: 
/proc/cpuinfo, /proc/meminfo, /proc/PID/

## /root - Root User Home Directory

### Purpose: 
Home directory for the root user (superuser)
### Location: 
Separate from /home for security and availability
### Access: 
Only accessible by root user
### Critical: 
Available even if /home is on separate filesystem

## /run - Runtime Data

### Purpose: 
Runtime data for processes since last boot
### Contents: 
PID files, socket files, temporary runtime data
### Modern: 
Replaces various locations like /var/run
### Volatile: 
Cleared on system reboot

## /sbin - System Binaries

###Purpose: 
Essential system binaries for system administration
### Contents: 
Commands typically used by system administrators
### Examples: 
fsck, mount, iptables, systemctl
### Access: 
Usually requires root privileges

## /srv - Service Data

### Purpose: 
Data served by the system
### Contents: 
Web server files, FTP data, repository data
### Examples: 
/srv/www for web content, /srv/ftp for FTP data
### Optional: 
Not all systems use this directory

## /sys - System Information Pseudo-filesystem

### Purpose: 
Virtual filesystem exposing kernel objects
### Contents: 
Hardware information, kernel parameters
### Interface: 
Provides interface to kernel data structures
### Modern: 
Part of sysfs filesystem introduced in Linux 2.6

## /tmp - Temporary Files

### Purpose: 
Temporary files created by programs
### Cleanup: 
Files may be deleted on reboot
### Access: 
World-writable with sticky bit set
### Volatile: 
Not guaranteed to persist across reboots

## /usr - User System Resources

### Purpose: 
Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data
Subdirectories:

/usr/bin - User binaries
/usr/lib - User libraries
/usr/share - Architecture-independent data
/usr/local - Local software installations


Read-only: Typically mounted read-only in production

## /var - Variable Data

### Purpose: 
Variable data files that change during system operation

### Contents:
/var/log - Log files
/var/cache - Application cache data
/var/spool - Spool files (mail, print queues)
/var/tmp - Temporary files preserved between reboots


Growing: Directory contents grow over time
