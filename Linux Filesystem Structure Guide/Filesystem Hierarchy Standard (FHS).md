# Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
The Linux filesystem structure follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, which:
Defines directory structure and directory contents
Ensures consistency across different Linux distributions
Separates shareable vs. non-shareable files
Distinguishes between variable and static files

## Key Principles
### Separation of Concerns: 
Different types of data are stored in appropriate directories
### Security: 
System files are separated from user files
### Maintainability: 
Standard locations make system administration easier
### Portability: 
Applications can rely on standard directory locations

## Navigation Tips
Use ls -la / to view root directory contents with permissions
Use df -h to see filesystem usage and mount points
Use mount to view currently mounted filesystems
Use man hier for detailed filesystem hierarchy information

## Security Considerations
System directories like /bin, /sbin, /etc should be protected
User directories in /home should have appropriate permissions
Temporary directories like /tmp need special permission handling
Device files in /dev require careful access control
